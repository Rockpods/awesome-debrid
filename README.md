## What is a Debrid service?
Debrid services are web apps that provide premium access to multiple file hosts. This enables users to download or stream content from various sources through a single account, often at higher speeds and with fewer restrictions.

## Why They Are Awesome
- **Enhanced Speed:** Debrid services typically offer faster download speeds compared to free hosts.
- **One Account, Multiple Hosts:** Access content from various file hosts using just one debrid account.
- **Cost-Effective:** More affordable than subscribing to multiple premium file hosting services.
- **Improved Reliability:** Better uptime and more consistent download speeds.
